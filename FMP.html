        <h1>CarePal</h1>
        
        <h4>Informal caregivers of people with dementia face high caring workloads and report high levels of stress. There is a need to assist them by keeping them informed about what their loved one is doing, without always needing to be present at home. That’s why I designed the app CarePal to support remote monitoring for informal caregivers. CarePal guides informal caregivers to find the most suitable sensing tools to monitor what their loved ones with dementia are doing when they are home alone. CarePal also presents intuitive data visualization to allow informal caregivers easily understand the monitoring contents. During this project, The double diamond design model was used as the guideline for the design process, covering four phases: Discover & empathize, define, develop and deliver. There are two main contributions from this project. The first is that this project builds a framework of 6 remote monitoring system design features desired by informal caregivers of PWD, which provides a basis for designing future monitoring user experience for informal caregivers. The second is the Figma prototype CarePal. It covers three desired features. After user testing, the prototype proved to provide efficiency in the care process for informal caregivers of PWD without adding stress. A highlight of stress handling here was that three UI elements have been shown to help alleviate the stress of false alarms from the system. In the end, users also agreed that they would use CarePal if it became available in the market.
