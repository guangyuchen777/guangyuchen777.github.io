        <h4>People with dementia living at home experience difficulties in participating in social interactions, while staying in contact with family adds quality to their lived experience. Initiating communication can be challenging for family, since there is a natural disparity between their life patterns and those of people with dementia. In this paper, we present CoasterChat, an exploration in design that embeds asynchronous digital communication in a daily coffee routine to support social sharing between people with early stage dementia and their family. In this preliminary study, the aim is to explore suitable interaction design that provides an opportunity for technology to be embedded in existing individual routines. Initial results show the importance of personalization in digital guidance. Benefit for family who engage in the interaction lies in the flexibility and accessibility of asynchronous communication. Finally, we discuss that these routines enhance social relationships which demonstrates the opportunities of creating a meaningful interaction between people with dementia and family members.</h4>
