                        <h4>
                            Aging Population
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            I come from China and the prediction shows that by 2050, there will be around 120 million people who are 80 years or older living in China alone, which counts for a quarter of this age group worldwide [1]. This demographic shift has increased pressure on health care, housing, mobility, public facilities [2], etc. I have no siblings to share the responsibility of taking care of parents with and it is not very likely our government will cover all the costs. As my parents get older, these pressures are getting closer and more visible. I understand that it is not only my family facing these problems, there will be a huge group facing similar situations [3]. As an industrial designer, I sense design opportunities in ageing society.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            Data & AI Becomes Common Design Material
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Data-related technologies like AI and IoT might contribute a lot to the field of aging population. In addition to physical materials, data is gradually becoming a new creative design material [4]. One concrete solution is elderly smart homes that involve data technologies. For example, wellness monitoring can detect or even predict critical moments for the older adults, based on the previous behavioral data. Such conveniences can make it much less challenging for the elders to live an independent life in their own home for longer [5].
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            Technology Is Not the Solution for Everything
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Having a technical background, I have to admit that I've gone from a vision of "technology is the most important part of the solution" to a vision of "technology is not the solution to everything", especially for the elderly population. Designers should always keep in mind the vulnerability of the elderly population. Many older people may be unfamiliar with new technology and they just cannot adapt to it as well as younger generations [6]. Therefore, designers need not only rigorous technology, but also patience and empathy throughout the design process.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            Designing for the Elderly Requires Diverse Design Activities
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Considering the vulnerability of the elderly population, designers need to consider their specific circumstances when planning design activities. For example, it can be very difficult to directly ask elderlies for their opinion on the application of new technology [6], so some hands-on design activities (like card sorting) can help break the question down into specific, interesting pieces that are easier to understand. As another example, when some older adults do not like to express their complaints due to dignity or fear of burdening others [7], contextual research deploying sensing tools in their living environment may provide objective and detailed insights into their wellness.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            Aging Population Is Not Only about the Elderly
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Last year, my grandma was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease. I noticed that dementia is a challenge not only for the older adults, but also for informal caregivers like my dad and his sister. They report high levels of emotional, physical, and financial stress [8]. My aunt said she felt like a heart attack after teaching my grandma how to pee in the right place multiple times and failed. I understand these frustrations and see how the design for an aging population is not just about older adults, it's also about the groups that provide care. Only when the caregiver is physically and mentally healthy can the elderly be cared for. Therefore, I set the informal caregivers of people with dementia as the target users of my FMP.

                            I regard myself as an engineering designer with a passion for technology and problem-solving, capable of independently planning and structuring a complete design process while being able to communicate with different stakeholders.

                        <h4>
                            From Engineer to Engineering Designer
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Before studying industrial design in the Netherlands, I finished a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in China. I think engineering thinking has always been in my design projects. I'm always proactive in development work on team projects, very open to new technologies, and excited for trouble-shooting. Over the past few years, I have gradually transitioned from an engineer to an engineering designer. This meant that in addition to technical and problem-solving skills, I gradually developed communication skills involving multiple stakeholders, planning skills to organize design activities to be performed during the design process, and writing skills that inform others about my design status and research findings.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            Strength & Weakness
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            On the one hand, I think the engineering mindset allows me to face up to the technical details and problems. But on the other hand, the technical details sometimes make me forget the bigger picture. In my M21, I spent a week learning a new javascript library just to generate one data visualization, without considering whether it would be a good time investment in a project with strict time restrictions. In my FMP, I had thorough plans at the beginning for what to do and learn, so I felt the design process was more clear and goal-oriented.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another pair of strength and weakness lies in data processing and data collection. As much as I love analyzing quantitative or qualitative data, I have always had difficulty recruiting target users for data collection. However, in my FMP, I finally got out of my comfort zone and approached a variety of groups for user research. I realized how easy it was once I started, because the participants would help introduce new participants, and I didn't even have to look for them myself at a later stage.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            I Believe Build up Data and AI Muscles Will Add Extra Strength for Designers
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Over the past few years, almost all of my courses and extracurricular activities have been on topics related to data and AI. I improved my data collection and analysis skills by using tools like OOCSSI, Arduino & Processing, Python and some JavaScript libraries. In addition, I also gained basic knowledge of ML algorithms, especially in the computer vision section. And I can use tools such as Python and WEKA to apply ML algorithms to the prototypes. On top of these, I also see some challenges and opportunities when applying data and AI to the design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, the predictive behavior of AI can be highly brilliant, or highly manipulative, or both.  As a designer, I think getting some AI muscle may become increasingly necessary because only then can we think more deeply about applying AI in a positive way. During my FMP I noticed that many older adults disliked the wellness prediction function because they believed that predicting "bad news" would add worry and stress to them and their families, which they see it as a kind of emotional manipulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, I think data collection technology such as IoT is extremely beneficial for designers because it opens up the possibility of digitizing the user experience so that designers can easily optimize for a better user experience.  In my M21 project, I used IoT technology to study the daily behavior of an older adult, which gave me richer insights than purely qualitative methods such as interviews or questionnaires. In my FMP, I used Useberry to quantitatively record user interactions with my prototype, which saves more time than human observation.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            I Observe What Older Adults Value
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            When looking back at the research and projects I've done, designing for older adults is not just about adding individual features to address individual deficiencies like solving a math problem, their dignity and connection to their family are also very important considerations. It is common for older adults to keep the hardships by themselves. The reasons are they still want to have the control of their own lives with dignity, and more importantly, they don't want to burden their adult children [8]. And the design for them should touch those values.

Starting from the courses Data Analytics for Engineers and Making Sense of Sensor, I gained great interest in quantitative data analysis. Gradually, I utilized IoT into my digital prototype, then Python to analyze the quantitative data I collect.  In the AI track from the bachelor honor academy, I learnt some Computer Vision algorithms, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN), and gained experience how to work in a team with students from math and computer science faculty.

From the elective Designing with Advanced Artificial Intelligence, I experienced putting Machine Learning algorithms and design together with the help from WEKA. The elective Creativity and Aesthetics of data & AI gave me insights into how AI can contribute to aesthetic interaction or vice versa. From the elective Data-enabled design I utilized sensor data to explore the contextual scenarios, discovered customized user experience, and interpreted those insights into a design intervention.  Another elective Embodying intelligent behavior helped me gain experience on applying algorithms with the help of Python, into a specific social context.

                        In my FMP, I used my data analysis skills to process interview content. Interview scripts were processed and clustered into themes using thematic analysis methods, and the results of card sorting activities were transformed and aggregated prior to data visualization. I'm happy that the combined results eventually become meaningful new knowledge for future studies.

                        <span style="font-weight:bold">Past: </span>So far, most of my big projects have been about aging population. I have tried different user research methods to empathize with older adults in the face of different purposes, situations or resources. In the bachelor, user interview was the most common method I use. It gives in-depth insights into users' opinions, but also require a lot of time and effort to conduct, transcribe, and analyze. In my FBP, I have tried using only literature reviews to understand my target older adults. The disadvantage is its difficulty for designers to empathize with users. After all, literature highlights the essence of knowledge, and the real context in which the problem is located cannot be displayed in detail.
                    </p>  
                    <p >
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">Present: </span>Considering design context is a very important design premise, and neither user interviews nor literature review can really provide this, thus in my M21, in order to understand the everyday context in particular, I tried to build and deploy various sensing tools in an old lady's house. This helped me explore open-ended the daily challenges one older person may face at home. This method is more objective than user interviews and can uncover many overlooked details in everyday life. But deploying sensors in the houses of a large number of users requires great time and effort. It is more suitable for case studies.
                    </p> 
                    <p >
                        In my FMP, after setting the general direction based on the literature, I decided to use interviews and card sorting activities to understand the real experiences of multiple stakeholders. One of my FMP goals was to empathize with older adults with dementia. But since the vulnerable nature of the dementia disease I could not interview this group alone. What I could try was to get closer to their real willing. So I decided to ask average older adults and informal caregivers of people with dementia, to help me understand this group from the perspectives of natural aging and the dementia disease, respectively. After the study, I noticed difference among different perspectives and found some research gap if we were to get closer to the real willingness of older adults with dementia. They are elaborated in my FMP report. 
                    </p>
                    <p >
                        My biggest challenge in my FMP was participant recruitment, especially considering I wanted to talk to two groups and I didn't speak the local language. After looking for numerous experts and colleagues to recommend users, but still not enough people participated, I plucked up the courage to ask stranger older people in the neighborhood. To my surprise, they were so willing to help strangers like me, even introducing their neighbors to participate, so very soon I didn't need to actively recruit anymore. Within a week I had enough healthy older participants. Similar stories also happened to informal caregivers.

Instead of the commonly used screen-based control as interaction, alternative interaction theories such as concrete interactions and tangible interactions of IoT devices may provide new ideas for the design of practical tools. I also believe that the three properties of interactive products (form, function, and interaction) are practical aesthetic guidelines when designing practical tools such as IoT devices.
